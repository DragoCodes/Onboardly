# Face Authentication System

## Project Overview
The **Face Authentication System** offers a secure and user-friendly method for remote identity verification through:
* **ü™™ Document Verification**: Utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to validate ID cards and documents.
* **üë§ Facial Recognition**: Matching user faces against uploaded documents.
* **‚úã Liveness Detection**: Real-time gesture and movement verification to ensure authenticity.
* **üñ•Ô∏è User Interface**: Providing a seamless interaction experience via Gradio or PyQt.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Multi-Service Backend**: Leveraging FastAPI and BentoML for efficient model serving.

## Functionalities
### 1. Document Verification (OCR)
* **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from ID cards and documents using OCR technology.
* **Data Comparison**: Compares extracted data with user-provided input for validation.
* **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to Know Your Customer (KYC) and onboarding regulations.

### 2. Face Matching
* **Image Comparison**: Compares user facial images captured via webcam with those on official documents.
* **Embedding Techniques**: Employs embedding-based methods to achieve high accuracy in face matching.

### 3. Liveness Detection
* **Gesture Analysis**: Utilizes Mediapipe for real-time gesture recognition.
* **Spoof Detection**: Identifies and prevents spoofing attempts using static photos or video replays.
* **Frame Validation**: Implements frame-by-frame gesture validation to ensure user presence.

### 4. GUI Interface
* **Webcam Integration**: Facilitates webcam capture for real-time user interaction.
* **File Uploads**: Allows users to upload necessary documents securely.
* **Video Verification**: Supports video-based liveness verification processes.

### 5. Modular Model Serving
* **Service Modes**: Supports both FastAPI and BentoML for flexible model serving.
* **Deployment Flexibility**: Allows dynamic switching between local and remote models based on requirements.

### 6. Logging & Config Management
* **Unified Logging**: Implements Loguru for consistent and comprehensive logging.
* **Configuration Schema**: Utilizes Pydantic for flexible and reliable configuration management.
